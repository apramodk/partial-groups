## Pokemon like battle game
We are wanting to create a pixel game that will be somewhat like a pokemon game boy game. It will be without the adventure part, and if it has some adventure, it will be minimal. We will create different monsters, names, and moves. We def need help with the front end of this project. We will most likely code this in C++.
